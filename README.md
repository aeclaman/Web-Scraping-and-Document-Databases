# Web-Scraping-and-Document-Databases
This project does webscraping using Flask, PyMongo, Pandas and BeautifulSoup. The html will render with existing database data. If the database is empty or nonexistant, the app will do an initial web scrape to load the database. The user can also choose to scrape for new data at the push of a button at any time.

The app can be downloaded and run locally by doing the following from terminal windows:  
  run mongod  
  run python app.py 

The app was also deployed to heroku and can be run at https://aeclaman-web-scraping.herokuapp.com/

Thanks!
